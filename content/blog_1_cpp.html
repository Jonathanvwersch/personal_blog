'<p>While most companies have struggled to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic, organisations offering massive open online
    courses have thrived as more and more people are turning to online education. One such company is <a
        href="https://www.udacity.com/">Udacity</a>. Started in 2011 by German computer scientist <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Thrun">Sebastian Thrun</a>, Udacity is perhaps best known for
    its<a href="https://www.udacity.com/nanodegree"> Nanodegree program </a>— three to four-month-long courses on a
    range of topics related to business and programming.</p>\r\n<p>While these courses usually cost upwards of $300 per
    month (and are expected to take 3–4 months at 10 hours a week), from the period of March to July, Udacity was
    offering one free month of access to any of their Nanodegrees. After finishing university, and finding all my
    graduation travel plans cancelled, I thought I would use my time wisely and attempt to finish <a
        href="https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213">Udacity’s C++ Nanodegree</a> within the
    one-month free trial. After doing so back in June, here are my thoughts on the course.</p>\r\n<h2
    id="-course-structure-">Course Structure</h2>\r\n<p>The course is made up of five projects, each of which is
    preceded by short informational videos, as well as exercises.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Project 1:</strong> Building a route
    planner to find the shortest path between two points on a map</p>\r\n<p><strong>Project 2: </strong>Building an
    object-oriented Linux system monitor</p>\r\n<p><strong>Project 3: </strong>Creating a chat bot, with a focus on
    memory management, which answers questions related to C++</p>\r\n<p><strong>Project 4:</strong> Development of a
    traffic light simulator using multi-threading principles</p>\r\n<p><strong>Project 5:</strong> Build your own C++
    application from scratch or develop on top of an already built Snake game</p>\r\n<p>You can choose to program the
    projects either on your computer or on Udacity’s virtual Linux machine. While each project has specific criteria
    which must be met to pass the course, you are free to go the extra mile and add additional features outside the
    scope of the assignment.</p>\r\n<h2 id="the-good">The Good</h2>\r\n<p><strong>1)</strong> The feedback you receive
    for each project submission is excellent. It is personalised, detailed, and constructive.</p>\r\n<p>
    <strong>2)</strong> You are given a lot of free reign in the final project. This means you can build just about
    anything you want so long as it meets the criteria, which are not limiting by any means.</p>\r\n<p><strong>3)
    </strong>You are provided with a range of videos on improving your online presence with regards to LinkedIn and
    Github, which are both useful and insightful. And you have the opportunity to have your LinkedIn profile reviewed
    and critiqued by a member of the Udacity team.</p>\r\n<p><strong>4)</strong> The course covers a range of topics,
    from the more basic elements of C++ such as classes and loops, to more complex subjects like move semantics, and
    dynamic memory allocation.</p>\r\n<p><strong>5)</strong> Udacity’s Student Hub is a great place to chat and ask for
    help from other students undertaking the Nanodegree.</p>\r\n<p><strong>6) </strong>The first two projects are
    excellent and give you a good insight into the fundamentals of C++, as well as object-oriented programming.</p>\r\n
<h2 id="the-bad">The Bad</h2>\r\n<p><strong>1)</strong> It is very expensive. If you pay upfront, it will cost you over
    $1000.</p>\r\n<p><strong>2) </strong>The learning material leading up to projects three and four is poorly taught.
    Memory management is so critical in C++ and I would have loved if the teaching quality had been better for that
    section of the course. I also did not enjoy projects three and four. I didn’t find them particularly difficult but I
    also did not understand what I was doing, which meant that I completed the projects having learned very little.</p>
\r\n<p><strong>3)</strong> There are occasional UI issues, particularly in the latter part of the course. For some
    reason, Udacity chose to cram a lot of the learning material into small boxes, which had scaling issues leading to a
    lot of text being cut off. Evident by messages left in the Student Hub, this was not an issue I faced alone.</p>\r\n
<p><strong>4) </strong>Each Nanodegree has a forum where you can ask questions to mentors when you are stuck on a
    certain aspect of a project. For the most part, the answers from the mentors are quite poor.</p>\r\n<h2
    id="verdict">Verdict</h2>\r\n<p>Don’t bother taking this course. I mean I don’t regret it cause I did it for free
    but in no way could I recommend this course to someone who would be paying full price. The project feedback is great
    but the teaching, particularly in the latter stages of the course, is too poor to justify the steep price. It is
    important to note that you are expected to have a basic knowledge of C++ before taking the course and I think that
    that is a fair statement. Ultimately, while Udacity’s C++ teachers are well qualified in terms of their programming
    abilities, great programmers do not necessarily make great teachers and I think that this course is proof of that.

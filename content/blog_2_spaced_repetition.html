    Active Recall, Spaced Repetition and the Note Taking Fallacy</h1>
<p>It’s a familiar interaction we all know too well — you meet someone for the first time, you exchange handshakes,
    niceties, and then five minutes later you realise that you’ve completely forgotten their name. How is that possible?
    Is our memory just that frail or are there other forces at work? The question of <em>why</em> we tend to forget
    information so quickly is far too complex to be answered in this article. But providing an answer to <em>how</em> we
    can improve our memory retention is possible. To do so, let’s begin our story in 19th century Germany.</p>
<h2 id="hermann-ebbinghaus-and-the-forgetting-curve">Hermann Ebbinghaus and The Forgetting Curve</h2>
<p>In 1885, German scientist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Ebbinghaus">Hermann Ebbinghaus</a> published
    his seminal work, <a href="https://archive.org/details/memorycontributi00ebbiuoft/mode/2up">*Memory: A Contribution
        to Experimental Psychology</a>*. The monograph described various experiments he conducted on himself related to
    learning and forgetting. The most ground-breaking of which involved memorising a list of logatomes or nonsensical
    syllables — consonant-vowel-consonants where the consonant does not repeat and the syllable has no prior meaning
    (examples of which include dax, mek, gim, hes). These nonsensical syllables, 2300 in total, were chosen as they have
    no meaning, and therefore eliminate any confounding factors. Ebbinghaus spent more than a year meticulously
    recording how many times he studied each list, the time interval between his study sessions, as well as how much he
    was able to remember. Then, to prove that these results were not accidental, he repeated the same experiment one
    year later.</p>

        alt="Portrait of Hermann Ebbinghaus"><em>Portrait of Hermann Ebbinghaus</em></p>
<p>While his experiments were internally valid — that is to say, he avoided most confounding factors — they lacked
    external validity as he was the sole subject in his study. Nonetheless, the results of his work served as one of the
    first instances of an individual attempting to record how memory decays over time and culminated in what would later
    go on to be named the<strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve">Forgetting
            Curve</a></strong>.</p>

            monograph</a></em></p>
<p>The Forgetting Curve pictured above was plotted using data collected from Ebbinghaus’ experiments. The results are
    frankly quite astonishing. Within one day, he had forgotten over 70% of what he had learned. Perhaps with findings
    such as these, it is unsurprising that we often forget peoples’ names so quickly.</p>
<p>The issue with Ebbinghaus’ interpretation of the Forgetting Curve is that it suggests that all memories simply fade
    away over time, which is not entirely true. After all, why is it that we can remember old phone numbers and
    addresses, which we haven’t thought about for many years?</p>
<h2 id="robert-bjork-s-theory-of-forgetting">Robert Bjork’s Theory of Forgetting</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_A._Bjork">Robert Bjork</a> is a Distinguished Professor of Psychology
    at the University of California, Los Angeles. He has dedicated the bulk of his career to better understanding human
    learning and memory.</p>
<p><a href="https://bjorklab.psych.ucla.edu/research/#:~:text=The%20New%20Theory%20of%20Disuse,(or%20retrievable">Bjork’s
        theory of forgetting</a>%20something%20is.) states that memories can be distinguished by two different
    strengths, namely retrieval strength and storage strength.</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong> <strong>Retrieval strength </strong>refers to how likely you are to access and recall a memory
    right now. For instance, to score highly on an exam, the memory in question needs to exhibit high retrieval
    strength.</p>
<p><strong>2)</strong> <strong>Storage strength </strong>refers to how deeply embedded a certain memory is in your mind.
    The idea is that barring some form of brain damage, storage strength, unlike retrieval strength, cannot decrease
    over time but can increase through repeated recall.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*Db1J3Q_ZIGgVE-EhPpV3kg.png"
        alt="Examples of memories with varying retrieval and storage strengths"><em>Examples of memories with varying
        retrieval and storage strengths</em></p>
<p>Therefore, Ebbinghaus’ Forgetting Curve is not a depiction of how our memories fade away over time but rather a
    graphical representation of the decay in our retrieval strength. The memories are there, we just need to bring them
    back to the surface. Enter in spaced repetition.</p>
<p><a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition#:~:text=Spaced%20repetition%20is%20an%20evidence,exploit%20the%20psychological%20spacing%20effect.">Spaced
        repetition</a> is a learning technique that involves reviewing previously learned material at systematic
    intervals. By doing so, one can retain information for long periods of time. Ebbinghaus was aware of the
    effectiveness of spaced repetition. In his research, <a
        href="https://archive.org/details/memorycontributi00ebbiuoft/page/88/mode/2up?q=with+ANY+">he concluded that</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>“With any considerable number of repetitions, a suitable distribution of them over a space of time is decidedly
        more advantageous than the massing of them at a single time.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But despite these findings, <a
        href="https://www.supermemo.com/en/blog/post/did-ebbinghaus-invent-spaced-repetition">Ebbinghaus did not study
        the effect of spaced repetition on memory retrievability</a>. In fact, in-depth research on the effectiveness of
    spaced repetition would only take place nearly a century later courtesy of a Polish researcher who sought to find
    the optimal study interval times to maximise memory retention.</p>
<h2 id="piotr-wozniak-active-recall-and-the-supermemo-algorithm">Piotr Wozniak, Active Recall and the SuperMemo
    Algorithm</h2>
<p>In the 1980s Polish researcher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piotr_Wo%C5%BAniak_(researcher">Piotr
        Wozniak</a>) grew frustrated with the sheer amount of information he had to learn while at university. His
    frustrations led him to develop <a href="https://www.supermemo.com/en">SuperMemo</a>, the first software to take
    advantage of spaced repetition. The software enables users to practice active recall (learning by testing) by
    allowing them to save questions and their respective answers. The software’s ingenuity is that it would show saved
    questions to the user when the algorithm believes that they are about to forget or lose their retrieval strength of
    the memory. The user then must rate their relative ease of recall (from 1 to 5). This allows the algorithm to
    “learn” when next to ask the question to the user.</p>

        to live a life of anonymity.</em></p>
<p>Piotr’s research and software brought rise to an updated version of the Forgetting Curve, which provides a more
    holistic representation of how our memories decay over time. The idea being that we can flatten the curve and reset
    decay by recalling memories at systematic intervals.</p>

<p>In the decades since, several studies have verified the notion that active recall coupled with spaced repetition is
    the most effective form of learning. I invite you to read this study from <a
        href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b620/5dc7c9224c5d6515d5ea470e6f2edb9c80f2.pdf">2010</a> or this one from
    <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/331/6018/772.full">2011</a> for proof of these claims.</p>
<p>The unfortunate reality is that very few people are aware of the effectiveness of pairing these two study methods.
    Students favour note taking and summarising, despite their relative ineffectiveness. In a <a
        href="https://bigthink.com/neurobonkers/assessing-the-evidence-for-the-one-thing-you-never-get-taught-in-school-how-to-learn">2013</a>
    paper, ten different techniques were evaluated for their effectiveness in improving learning. What they found was
    that summarisation, highlighting, and rereading were all wholly ineffective methods of learning while practice
    testing (active recall) and distributed practice (active recall coupled with spaced repetition) were the most
    optimum methods.</p>

<p>So, what does this all mean? Should you stop taking notes? Should you adopt spaced repetition and active recall into
    your learning? According to the research — yes. But the reality is, of course, a bit more complicated. If you fair
    well as a note-taker, then maybe there is no reason to stop, but for those who are struggling to memorise
    information, it’s probably time to listen to the experts.</p>
<h2 id="incorporating-active-recall-and-spaced-repetition-into-your-learning">Incorporating Active Recall and Spaced
    Repetition into your Learning</h2>
<p>The best way to incorporate active recall into your learning is to start asking more questions. Rather than rereading
    or summarising your notes, create questions out of them. These could be in the form of flashcards or quizzes. The
    next important step is to optimally space out your study intervals.</p>
<p>If you prefer to create your flashcards manually, you can determine your spaced repetition intervals using methods
    such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner_system">Leitner System</a>. For digital flashcard
    learning, I’d recommend <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> — a web and mobile application that allows you
    to create flashcards and study them using spaced repetition.</p>
<p>If this article piqued your interest in understanding how to learn, I’d really recommend reading <a

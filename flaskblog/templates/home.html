          Welcome to my home on the internet. I built this website to learn the basics of web development but also with a
          desire to establish a more consistent writing habit. 

          <br><br>
          On this site, you can read my blog where I write about whatever interests me in the moment.

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
              In July of this year, I graduated with an integrated masters in mechanical engineering.
              I'm currently working as a robotics engineer. My goal in life is to build technology
              companies that make a difference in the lives of others.
